## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Firebase account with Firestore and Authentication configured
- Flask installed (`pip install flask`)
- Firebase Admin SDK (`pip install firebase-admin`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CPECreditTracker.git
   cd CPECreditTracker

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
            or
    source venv\Scripts\activate (windows)

3. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up Firebase:
- Create a Firebase project
- Enable Firestore and Authentication as needed
- Download Firebase Admin SDK credentials JSON file and save it in the project directory (e.g., `firebase_credentials.json`)

5. Configure environment variables or update the app configuration:
    Ensure the app knows where to find the Firebase credentials:
    bash: export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="firebase_credentials.json"
    Or update the path in firebase_config.py.

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
    bash: flask run or python app.py

2. Access the app at `http://localhost:5000`
